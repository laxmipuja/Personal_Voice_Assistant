# Personal Voice Assistant using Python

Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API called Speech Recognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing. In this article, we will look at converting large or long audio files into text using the Speech Recognition API in python.

## Problem Defination
A personal voice assistant, specifically designed for the needs of blind or specially-abled individuals, can help solve this problem by providing a simple and intuitive interface that they can interact with using only their voice. Such an assistant can help users perform a wide range of tasks and access information without relying on sight or traditional interfaces.

The aim of this technology is to empower these individuals by giving them more independence and control over their lives, allowing them to live more fulfilling and meaningful lives. By providing a voice-based interface that can understand and respond to natural language, this technology can help to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds for people with disabilities, enabling them to live more integrated and connected lives.
